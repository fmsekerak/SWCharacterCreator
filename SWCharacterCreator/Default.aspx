                DnD (Dungeons and Dragons) is a roleplay, turn-based game about storytelling and adventure. It
                is based on imagination where you can guide your heroes through quests, battles, and rescue
                missions. Star Wars DnD is a remake of Dungeons and Dragons based in the Star Wars universe.
                The first step for starting a DnD campaign is to create a character. Our plan is to make a
                character creator to help players keep track of assets important to their characters. Each
                player’s character has a race, class, and background features. Different races and classes have
                different skills and actions.

              <br /> <br />

                We plan on using SQL databases to store information relevant to the player's character. This
                would include races, classes, background, weapons, armour, force powers, tech. powers and
                more. The basis of our website would include using HTML, CSS, PHP, and possibly .NET. For a
                better understanding of what we are trying to do, there is an unfinished character creator
                already released (Characters | SW5E). Our plan is to make a better, more accurate character
                creator than what is released. We plan on getting our data from the official Star Wars 5e
                Player’s Handbook (Introduction | PHB | SW5E).

                 <br /> <br />

                The basic functions of the project will include the ability to insert character information like name, race,
                class etc. They will be able to edit this data at any time, and if need be delete it. They will be able to
                search and filter their characters by race, classes, etc.

                <br /> <br />

                The advanced functions of the project will be things not offered in the currently released version of this.
                One major thing not included is Multiclassing. Multiclassing is the ability for a character to have more
                than one class. This is very difficult to implement because there are certain features bound to only one
                class. If a character has two classes, they have access to features of both classes. This is very cool to
                include because it allows for players to be able to fully experience and play their characters.
                The second major function of the project will be including race and class benefits to character creation.
                This is another thing not included and makes character creation very hard. When viewing species and
                class benefits, they have to be manually input into the character creation. This can be very hard for new
                players and make it difficult for them to fully build their character.
